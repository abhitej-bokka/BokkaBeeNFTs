### Hello Everyone! Get a Metamask account and get some free Ethereum Rinkeby here to use my site:

### https://bokka-bee-nfts.herokuapp.com/

### You can also find a video of my demonstrating my project below so definitely check it out!

### What did I exactly do?

I developed NFTs depicting bees and deployed them on Ethereum Rinkeby Network using HardHat.

I constructed contracts with Solidity and remodeled a React.js front end to deploy NFTs with Metamask.

### How do you actually get one of my NFTs???

The first thing you will do is create a Metamask account and install it on your computer as part of a chrome extenstion here: https://metamask.io/

The next thing you will do once you have created your account is copy your public address of your account and go to https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby.

Paste your address into the section for wallet addresses and just select 0.1 test ETH

As soon as that 0.1 test ETH is in your account, you are free to mint as many NFTs as you like!

### If you want to run locally...

1. Clone the github repo
2. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
3. Run `npm run start` to start the project
4. And watch in amazement!
